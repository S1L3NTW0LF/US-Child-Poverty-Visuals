# US Poverty Tableau Visuals
#### The purpose of this visual was to investigate child poverty across states to see what the differences were and where it is worst. 

Shows child poverty across states and highlights the worst state, Mississippi in orange, and the best state, Connecticut in blue. The purpose of this visual was to show how large the difference between child poverty levels between states are.

Shows what states have worst child poverty levels by geographic region and highlight where it is worst in this case the South East. It also has tooltips so that the viewer can hover over states and see statistics (percent of black population, income per capita, unemployment) that could be related to child poverty. This allows to the viewer to see what statistics are high or low in the respective light (low poverty) and dark (high poverty) zones.

Gives an overview of the states poverty level in descending order and show the geographic hot spots for poverty and then show the positive correlation between the percentage of black population and child poverty rates. The states that are blue represent the states in the South East of the US so the viewer can compare what the percentage of black population looks like compared to the other states.

Shows the strong negative correlation between income and child poverty. States with higher average incomes have less poverty. The blue dots represent the South Eastern States so that the viewer can not only see the correlation between income and child poverty, but about where the South Eastern states fall in terms of income. In this case from the scatter plot it is obvious that they have some of the lowest incomes compared to the rest of the states.

Displays the large difference between child poverty and poverty as a whole. It communicates you can not assume that child poverty rates are similar to poverty rates in general and that it may be something that needs to be further investigated. There is likely to be a reason for such a large difference.
